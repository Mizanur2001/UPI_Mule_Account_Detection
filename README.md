## 🔍 Detection Algorithm

### Five Independent Risk Signals

**Behavioral (25%)**
- Velocity spikes (5-10+ transactions: +25-35 pts)
- New account rapid activity (0-7 days = +40 pts, 0-30 days = +30 pts)
- Pass-through ratio (80-120% inflow→outflow = +35 pts)
- Amount anomalies (avg > ₹5K = +20 pts, max > ₹10K = +15 pts)
- Total volume spike (> ₹50K = +20 pts)
- Pure sender pattern (no receiving txns = +20 pts)

**Graph Analysis (40%)** [STRONGEST SIGNAL]
- Star patterns: 3-5+ inflows → 1 outflow (+30-45 pts)
- Distributors: 1 inflow → 3-5+ outflows (+30-45 pts)
- Relay nodes: High in/out degree processing (+35 pts)
- Chains: Linear laundering paths A→B→C→D (+20-35 pts)
- Circular: Fund rotation loops A→B→C→A (+50 pts)

**Device (15%)**
- Device shared across 3-10+ accounts (+30-50 pts)
- Multi-device control / spoofing (+20-30 pts)

**Temporal (10%)**
- Rapid-fire bursts (< 60s between txns = +35 pts)
- Odd-hour activity (12AM-5AM concentration = +15-30 pts)
- Velocity spikes (3x+ rate increase = +25 pts)
- Weekend concentration (> 70% on weekends = +15 pts)
- Uniform timing / bot signature (low CV = +20-30 pts)

**ML Anomaly (10%)**
- Isolation Forest (unsupervised, pure NumPy implementation)
- Z-score statistical outlier detection
- Ensemble: 70% IF + 30% Z-score
- Labels: ANOMALOUS (70+), SUSPICIOUS (45-69), NORMAL (<45)

### Final Score
```
Base = (0.25 × Behavioral) + (0.40 × Graph) + (0.15 × Device)
     + (0.10 × Temporal) + (0.10 × ML Anomaly)

Boost: +8 (2 signals) / +15 (3 signals) / +20 (4+ signals)
       +10 (graph & device correlated) / +8 (behavioral & graph)
       +12 (extreme triple correlation)

Score = min(Base + Boost, 100)
```

### Risk Levels
- **CRITICAL (85+):** Block immediately — freeze account, alert compliance, file SAR
- **HIGH (70-84):** Investigate — manual review within 24h, enhanced monitoring
- **MEDIUM (40-69):** Monitor — add to watchlist, periodic review
- **LOW (<40):** Allow — normal operations, routine monitoring

- **Scalability:** Architecture scales linearly with account count

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Risk Thresholds
Edit `backend/core/risk_engine.py`:
```python
def risk_level(score):
    if score >= 85:      # CRITICAL threshold
        return "CRITICAL"
    elif score >= 70:    # HIGH threshold
        return "HIGH"
    elif score >= 40:    # MEDIUM threshold
        return "MEDIUM"
    return "LOW"
```

### Change Weight Distribution
Edit `backend/core/risk_engine.py`:
```python
base_score = (
    0.25 * behavioral   # Adjust weights (must sum to 1.0)
    + 0.40 * graph
    + 0.15 * device
    + 0.10 * temporal
    + 0.10 * ml_anomaly
)
```

### Tune ML Anomaly Detection
Edit `backend/core/ml_anomaly.py`:
```python
iforest = IsolationForestLite(
    n_trees=100,        # More trees = more stable (slower)
    max_samples=256,    # Subsample size per tree
)
# Ensemble weighting
ensemble_scores = 0.7 * anomaly_scores + 0.3 * z_normalized
```

### Add Custom Mule Scenarios
Edit `scripts/enhanced_data_generator.py` and add your pattern.

## 🎯 Market Fit & End-Use Cases

| User Segment | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| **UPI Payment Gateways** | Real-time transaction screening (BLOCK/FLAG/ALLOW) |
| **Banks / NBFCs** | AML compliance — SAR auto-generation, account freeze |
| **RBI / NPCI** | Systemic mule network detection across ecosystem |
| **Cyber Crime Cells** | Investigation support — forensic evidence trails |
| **Fintech / Neobanks** | Onboarding fraud prevention (new account risk scoring) |

### Competitive Differentiators
1. **Zero labeled data required** — unsupervised ML works from day 1
2. **5-factor ensemble** — no single-signal dependency
3. **Graph-first approach** — catches collusive networks (not just individuals)
4. **Explainable AI** — every score has human-readable evidence
5. **Lightweight** — pure NumPy ML, no heavy ML framework dependency
